- [ ] roast/S10-packages/require-and-use--dead-file.t
  - No longer panics (`Unknown call: our` fixed by parsing `our` declarations), but still fails all subtests because `require/use/no` return values and `%*INC` updates are not yet implemented correctly.
- [ ] roast/S10-packages/require-and-use.t
- [ ] roast/S10-packages/scope.t
  - No longer panics; still has broad package-scope semantic failures (module `use/require` scoping, import visibility, and `%*INC` behavior).
- [ ] roast/S10-packages/use-with-class.t
