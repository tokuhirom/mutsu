- [ ] roast/S03-buf/read-int.t
  - Constructor blocking is improved, but file now stops at `Unknown method value dispatch (fallback disabled): read-uint8`.
  - Remaining blocker: implement `Blob/Buf` read-int/read-uint family (`read-int8..128`, `read-uint8..128`) with endian handling.
- [ ] roast/S03-buf/read-num.t
  - Reaches 72/200 subtests, then exits due missing `Blob/Buf` numeric read family (`read-num32`, `read-num64`) behavior/completeness.

- [ ] roast/S03-junctions/boolean-context.t
- [ ] roast/S03-junctions/misc.t
  - 42/155 pass (88 reached). Good basic junction support (boolean context, if modifier, for loops, WHAT). Failures: junction.WHAT (2-3), Mu junction (18), substr/index on junctions (21-22, 24-25, 27-28, 30-31, 33-34), for over Junction gets Junction (37), array/hash indexing (42-44), regex in junction (48-50), .gist (51), flattening (55-57, 59). Difficulty: Medium-High

- [ ] roast/S03-metaops/eager-hyper.t
- [ ] roast/S03-metaops/hyper.t
- [ ] roast/S03-metaops/infix.t
  - `plan` now accepts integral Num/Rat values, so early `plan expects Int` abort is fixed.
  - Current blocker: callable code-ref invocation in this file dies (`Unknown function ...: op`).
- [ ] roast/S03-metaops/misc.t
- [ ] roast/S03-metaops/not.t
  - Panic on `&infix:<!===>(...)` is fixed; remaining failures are semantic gaps in `!` metaoperators (`!before/!after`, `!&&/!||/!^^`, and related callable forms).

- [ ] roast/S03-operators/adverbial-modifiers.t
  - 4/42 pass.
- [ ] roast/S03-operators/also.t
  - 7/8 pass. Test 6 fails: closures cannot mutate outer lexical variables (env is cloned by value, not shared by reference).
- [ ] roast/S03-operators/andthen.t
  - 4/14 pass. Tests 5-6: type objects not properly undefined. Tests 7-8: andthen thunking (closure as rhs). Tests 9-14: need try/die, `is-deeply`, `infix:<andthen>()`.
- [ ] roast/S03-operators/arith.t
  - 0/? pass. Panic: `attempt to multiply with overflow` in `i64::pow`. Needs BigInt or checked arithmetic.
- [x] roast/S03-operators/assign-is-not-binding.t
- [ ] roast/S03-operators/assign.t
  - Panic on infix routine `=` dispatch is fixed; current blocker is package/hash assignment semantics (hits `Unknown method value dispatch ... keys` and exits early).

- [ ] roast/S03-operators/numeric-shift.t
  - 0/38 pass.
- [ ] roast/S03-operators/orelse.t

  - 20/63 pass.
- [ ] roast/S03-operators/scalar-assign.t
  - 2/4 pass.
- [ ] roast/S03-operators/set_addition.t
  - Added minimal `SetHash/BagHash/MixHash` method support, type-object `.new`, `&infix:<...>` parsing for `⊎`, and callable infix routine dispatch.
  - Now reaches 46/395 tests; current blocker shifts to argument parsing/evaluation around `is-deeply` in this file (`is-deeply expects right`).
- [ ] roast/S03-operators/set_difference.t
  - 0/? pass. Crashes mid-run.
- [ ] roast/S03-operators/set_elem.t
  - First blocker moved from `.Map` dispatch (added basic `.Map`/`.Hash` conversion support) to `for &infix:<(elem)> ... -> &op` binding: infix codevar capture for `(elem)/(cont)` forms still resolves incorrectly, so `op(...)` is undefined.

- [ ] roast/S03-sequence/arity-2-or-more.t
- [ ] roast/S03-sequence/basic.t
  - 98/143 pass. Remaining blockers: Whatever-currying (*+2, +*), &prefix:<!>/&[+] function refs, is-deeply with Rat, throws-like X::Cannot::Empty, EVAL+.raku, Z~ zipping, *>=5 endpoint closures, ^N prefix range, code-on-RHS endpoints

  - 13/21 pass. Complex ~~ Int/Rat/Num smartmatch fails (12-13, 15-16, 18-19), rest of numeric smartmatching works. Difficulty: Low-Medium (Complex type smartmatching)
