- [ ] roast/S32-array/delete.t
- [ ] roast/S32-array/elems.t
  - 6/12 pass (1-5, 7). Failures: `.elems` on initialized arrayitems (6), `elems()` sub form with args (8-9), `elems [1,2,3,4]` (10), `elems` on itemized list (11). Only 11 tests reached. Difficulty: Low-Medium
- [ ] roast/S32-array/end.t
  - 7/12 pass (1-6, 8). `.end` works well on arrays. Failures: initialized arrayitems (7), sub form `end(1,2,3,4)` (9-10), `end [1,2,3,4]` (11), `end` on itemized list (12). Difficulty: Low-Medium

- [ ] roast/S32-array/perl.t
- [ ] roast/S32-array/pop.t
  - 11/38 pass (1, 12-13, 23-29). `.pop` mostly broken for sub form `pop(@arr)`. Method form `@arr.pop` has issues too (returns wrong value). Post-exhaustion behavior (returning undefined/Failure) works. Only 37 tests reached. Difficulty: Medium (pop sub form, return value issues)
- [ ] roast/S32-array/push.t
  - ~6/56 pass (1, 10-14). Push works but `.elems` returns wrong counts after push, causing most verification tests to fail. Basic `push @array, $value` and `~@p` work. Difficulty: Medium (array elems tracking after push)
- [ ] roast/S32-array/rotate.t
- [ ] roast/S32-array/shift.t
  - 11/33 pass (1, 11-12, 21-27, 33). Similar to pop: sub form `shift(@arr)` broken, method form has issues. Post-exhaustion returns undefined/Failure correctly. Difficulty: Medium
- [ ] roast/S32-array/splice.t
- [ ] roast/S32-array/unshift.t
  - 8/76 pass (1, 19, 22-23, and a few others). `@arr.unshift(val)` method works but doesn't return correct count. Sub form `unshift(@arr, val)` broken. Most element verification fails. Difficulty: Medium-High (unshift return value and sub form)
- [ ] roast/S32-basics/pairup.t
- [ ] roast/S32-basics/warn.t
  - 8/9 pass (11 reached, plan 9). Tests 1-2, 4-9 pass. Failures: CONTROL catching (3), smartmatch in warning context (10-11, outside plan). Very close! Difficulty: Low

  - 6/23 pass (1-2, 4-5, 13-14). `.keys` and `.values` work on hashes, `Any.keys`/`Any.values` work. Failures: element count comparison (3, 6), `Pair.keys`/`Pair.values` (7-12), `.kv` on pair with Mu (15-23). Difficulty: Medium (Pair.keys/values, Mu handling)
- [ ] roast/S32-hash/kv.t
  - 13/27 pass (1-2, 12-20, 22, 24). Good `.kv` support on hashes. Failures: sub form `kv(%hash)` (3-4), `Pair.kv` (5-7), constant hash refs (8-11), rw aliases in kv (21, 23, 25). Only 25 tests reached. Difficulty: Medium

  - ~12/31 pass (1, 3, 5, 7, 10-11, 15, 17, 19, 22-23, 27, 29). Crashes with `is-deeply expects right`. Failures: `first()` return value (2, 4, 6, 8), undefined match (9), Range-based first (12-13), type/regex lookup (14, 16, 18), junction matcher (20). Difficulty: Medium
- [ ] roast/S32-list/first-v.t
- [ ] roast/S32-list/flat.t
  - 1/21 pass (test 1 only: Nil.raku method form). Failures: sub form `flat()` (2), lazy list flattening (3-6), `.flat` on arrays (7-8). Only 8 tests reached. Difficulty: Medium (`.flat` needs proper implementation)
- [ ] roast/S32-list/grep-k.t

- [ ] roast/S32-list/grep-p.t
- [ ] roast/S32-list/grep.t

Failures: Range.head (4-5, 13), sub form `head(N, list)` (7-8, 10, 12, 14-15, 17-18), `.head(Nil)` (19-28), Range forms (34-36, 44-47), Rat coercion (49). Difficulty: Medium (sub form and Range support needed)
- [ ] roast/S32-list/iterator.t

Implemented: map function form (`map { }, @list`), Range-to-Array flattening for @-variables, `slip()` function and `Value::Slip`, `.Slip` method, multi-arity map (both `$^a`/`$^b` and `-> $a, $b` pointed blocks), `.()` invocation syntax, `next`/`last` in map, `.sink` method. Cannot whitelist: last section (lines 278-287) hangs due to `.iterator`/`.pull-one`/`IterationEnd`/`=:=` not implemented. Remaining failures: `#?rakudo skip` tests (4, 7-8), `is-deeply` tuple comparison (17-19), `$_` mutation aliasing (28), map on pair comma-list return (53), `&sprintf.assuming` (55), hash-context map (57), `s///` in map (58), `Any.map({ Slip })` type object (59), `.sink` side-effect propagation (61).

- [ ] roast/S32-list/rotor.t
- [ ] roast/S32-list/seq.t
- [ ] roast/S32-list/skip.t

- [ ] roast/S32-list/snip.t
- [ ] roast/S32-list/sort.t
  - ~20/74 pass. Basic sort works for method form on strings/numbers/lists. Crashes with `is-deeply expects right`. Failures: sort with comparator sub (1-5, 7, 12, 14-18), Schwartzian transform (18, 20), stability tests (27-28, 35), many advanced features. Difficulty: Medium-High
- [ ] roast/S32-list/squish.t
- [ ] roast/S32-list/tail.t
  - 0/? pass. Panics with `mul_overflow` in `i64::pow` at vm.rs:396. Likely a large negative exponent causing integer overflow before any tests run. Difficulty: Medium (need overflow-safe exponent handling)
- [x] roast/S32-list/toggle.t
- [ ] roast/S32-list/unique.t
  - 0/40 pass. `.unique` method not implemented. Only 2 tests reached, both fail. Difficulty: Medium (need to implement `.unique` method)

- [ ] roast/S32-str/chomp.t
  - 18/39 pass. Basic chomp works for `\n`. Failures: chomp with `\r\n` line endings (4, 11, 14-20, 23-24), various line-ending combinations (CR, CRLF). Difficulty: Low-Medium (need `\r\n` and `\r` line ending support in chomp)

- [ ] roast/S32-str/contains.t
  - Backend resolution now works (`$*RAKU.compiler.backend`) and `.contains` dispatch exists, but test still aborts after first assertion with uncaught `X::OutOfRange` in later cases.
- [ ] roast/S32-str/encode.t
  - 3/41 pass (2, 4, 7). Basic `.encode` works for ASCII/UTF-8. Failures: return type is not Blob (1), Buf length (3, 5-6), indexing encoded bytes (8-9), cp1252 encoding (10-11). Only 12 tests reached. Difficulty: Medium-High (Buf/Blob types needed)
- [ ] roast/S32-str/ends-with.t

- [ ] roast/S32-str/gb2312-encode-decode.t
- [ ] roast/S32-str/indent.t
  - 4/63 pass (5-8). `.indent` works for adding indent to already-indented strings. Failures: simple indent (1-4), same-space indent (9-17), mixed-space indent (18-39). Only 39 tests reached. Difficulty: Medium (`.indent` logic for various whitespace scenarios)
- [ ] roast/S32-str/index.t
  - 31/41 pass. Strong index support. Failures: pos at/after match (9-10), empty substr with pos beyond string (20-22), Cool.index wrong args (37), Buf.index (38-41). Difficulty: Low-Medium
- [ ] roast/S32-str/indices.t

  - 11/29 pass (2, 4, 6, 8, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26). `.chars` works well on all strings including Unicode. Failures: `.length` should be deprecated/error (1), `.codes` not implemented (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27-29). Difficulty: Low-Medium (add `.codes` method)
- [ ] roast/S32-str/lines.t
  - 4/27 pass (tests 1-4). LF `.lines` works without trailing and with Inf/*. Failures: `.lines` with numeric limit (5), CR line endings not handled (6-10), CRLF not handled (11-15), mixed line endings not handled (16-20). Remaining tests not reached due to runtime error "Expected IO::Handle". Difficulty: Medium (CR/CRLF line splitting + limit parameter)

  - 0/? pass. Panics with `mul_overflow` in `i64::pow` (vm.rs) before any tests run. Same overflow issue as base.t and tail.t. Difficulty: Medium
- [ ] roast/S32-str/ords.t
  - 3/9 pass (tests 1, 3, 5: function form `ords()` works). Failures: method form `.ords` returns wrong type or value (2, 4, 6), NFG synthetic handling (7-8). Only 8 tests reached (plan 9). Difficulty: Low-Medium (method `.ords` needs to return same as function form)
- [ ] roast/S32-str/parse-base.t
- [ ] roast/S32-str/pos.t
- [ ] roast/S32-str/rindex.t
  - 14/40 pass. Good basic support for `rindex`. Failures: pos parameter handling (3-5, 7-10, 12-14, 16-18, 20-21, 23), accented/unicode chars (24-26), rindex on variable (29), non-latin-1 strings (35), negative pos error handling (37), wrong args (38), list-of-needles (39-40). Difficulty: Medium (pos parameter and unicode handling)

- [ ] roast/S32-str/shiftjis-encode-decode.t
- [ ] roast/S32-str/space-chars.t
  - 0/30 pass. Regression: previously passed but now 0 tests run.
- [ ] roast/S32-str/split-simple.t
  - 3/30 pass (plan has subtests). Basic split works for simple delimiters. Failures: captured delimiter in split (3-5), `:v` adverb (6-7), `split('')` (9), type check exceptions (10-12). Difficulty: Medium

- [ ] roast/S32-str/substr-eq.t
- [ ] roast/S32-str/substr-rw.t
- [ ] roast/S32-str/substr.t
  - 32/57 pass. Good basic substr support. Failures: `*-1` last-char syntax (4-5), negative length (11-14), `.wordcase` method (21, 32, 40), Deseret chars (24-26), Range-based substr (43-52), WhateverCode arg (54). Difficulty: Medium
- [ ] roast/S32-str/tclc.t
  - 2/6 pass (2, 5). Failures: tclc sub form (1), German sharp s (3), lj ligature (4), high codepoints (6). Difficulty: Medium (Unicode case mapping edge cases)
- [ ] roast/S32-str/tc.t
  - 6/9 pass (1-4, 7-8). Failures: German sharp s (5), lj ligature (6), high codepoints (9). Difficulty: Medium (same Unicode case mapping issues)

- [ ] roast/S32-str/uc.t
  - 14/20 pass (1-14). Failures: `but` mixin on strings (15-17), precomposed upper character (18-19), prepend codepoints uppercasing (20). Difficulty: Low-Medium
