# S24 - testing

- [x] roast/S24-testing/0-compile.t
  - 1/1 pass.
- [ ] roast/S24-testing/10-is-approx.t
- [ ] roast/S24-testing/11-plan-skip-all-subtests.t
  - 2/4 pass. Tests 1-2 were passing trivially (colon-pair hash parsed as block, is_run expectations not tested). Now properly tests expectations; fails because is_run code uses `plan skip-all` and expects specific error output.
- [x] roast/S24-testing/11-plan-skip-all.t
  - 0/0 pass (skipped).
- [x] roast/S24-testing/12-subtest-todo.t
  - 8/8 pass.
- [ ] roast/S24-testing/13-cmp-ok.t
  - 1/2 pass. Test 1 was passing trivially (colon-pair hash parsed as block, is_run expectations not tested). Now properly tests expectations; fails because is_run code uses anonymous class with method overrides.
- [ ] roast/S24-testing/14-like-unlike.t
- [ ] roast/S24-testing/15-done-testing.t
- [x] roast/S24-testing/1-basic.t
  - 39/39 pass.
- [ ] roast/S24-testing/2-force_todo.t
- [ ] roast/S24-testing/3-output.t
  - 5/6 pass. Test 4 fails: requires `qqx` (shell command capture) and `todo()` with reason text output. Was previously passing accidentally due to incorrect argument parsing.
- [x] roast/S24-testing/6-done_testing.t
  - 3/3 pass.
- [x] roast/S24-testing/7-bail_out.t
  - 4/4 pass.
- [ ] roast/S24-testing/8-die_on_fail.t
  - 2/6 pass. Tests 1-2, 4, 6 were passing trivially (colon-pair hash parsed as block, is_run expectations not tested). Now properly tests expectations; fails because is_run code requires BEGIN, %*ENV access, and RAKU_TEST_DIE_ON_FAIL support.
- [ ] roast/S24-testing/9-is_deeply.t
- [ ] roast/S24-testing/fails-like.t
- [ ] roast/S24-testing/line-numbers.t
  - 0/15 pass. Was previously in whitelist due to `loose_ok` hack (like always returned true). Requires: test failure output to include "at <file> line <N>" in stderr, `is test-assertion` trait, `run()` with `:err` capture, `$proc.err.slurp`.
