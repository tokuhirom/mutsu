# Roast subset

These small programs are adapted from roast examples to exercise the minimal
syntax currently supported by mutsu. They are *not* full roast tests; they are
standalone programs with expected stdout outputs.

Source inspiration (roast):
- `../roast/S02-literals`
- `../roast/S04-statements`
